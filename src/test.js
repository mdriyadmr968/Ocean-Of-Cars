    desc: "If you’re looking for a small, easy-to-drive car but don’t want to compromise on quality, the Audi A1 Sportback is well worth a look. It’s a bit like Fabergé egg, because it’s small and looks and feels expensive, but does cost a fair whack to buy in the first place, even if it’s pretty cheap to run after that. ",

Quite simply, it’s going to be a brilliant all-round car – comfortable, practical, good to drive and desirable.That combination has meant the 3 Series is a bigger seller than the likes of a Ford Mondeo, these days. Why? The same reason you might buy Ethiopian coffee beans over instant, or fresh sourdough over a loaf of Hovis: you don’t mind paying just a bit more for top quality.",

It’s an alternative to the BMW X1 and Volvo XC40 and sits between the Q2 and Q5 in the enormous range of SUVs available in Audi’s line-up.That line-up can be a bit like watching Eastenders and trying to decide which Mitchell brother is on the screen – they do look very similar. That’s good in some cases and bad in others, depending on the price they’re charging. The Q3 is, thankfully, in the sweet spot.",

At the same time, however, it’s priced in such a way that if you’re looking at a slightly humbler option – you know, like a Ford Focus or a Vauxhall Astra – it wouldn’t be a stretch to think the Golf might also be on your shortlist.",

Everything is becoming larger, more luxurious and high-tech, with increasingly aggressive styling.Well, bringing more than a little ‘grrr’ to the party is the Audi Q7, with its angular headlights and vast grille. Looks are deceiving, though, because this big seven-seater is comfortable, not carnivorous.",
